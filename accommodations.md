We've scouted hotels in Novi Sad and want to share our recommendations and observations to help you choose the best fit for your stay.

## A Few Notes About Hotels in Serbia

Hotels in Serbia can be a bit different from what you might expect in the U.S. For example, reception areas may be more modest, and queen or king beds often come with two separate individual-sized blankets and one pillow per person.

We recommend staying in Novi Sad's beautiful city center, which features a large pedestrian area with cafes, small shops, and the church where our ceremony will be held. This area is also walkable to our welcome dinner on Thursday evening. We've chosen small boutique hotels and rooms that capture the history and spirit of the area—while they're not fancy, we've visited each one and can vouch for their charm.

## Boutique Hotels

*These hotels have full-time reception areas, restaurants, and bars.*

**Fontana Hotel** (19 rooms)
A small hotel just steps outside the pedestrian zone on a quiet street in a charming historic building with a restaurant and outdoor terrace. Some rooms have balconies. Simple, clean rooms.

**Veliki Hotel** (14 rooms)
Well-located across from the Fontana and attached to a popular restaurant with the same name. Note that some rooms are updated while others are not.

## Rooms Above Restaurants & Cafes

*These are rooms above restaurants or cafes with reception areas that might have limited hours.*

**Lanterna Rooms** (8 rooms)
Lovely, clean and bright rooms above a popular pizza restaurant at the edge of the pedestrian zone (about 4 blocks from the church) and near the entrance to the must-see Dunavski Park. The staff is warm and accommodating. Note: one room has no windows, so be sure to confirm your room type when booking.

**Corso Rooms** (8 rooms)
Rooms above a popular cafe in the heart of the pedestrian zone. Recently refurbished with comfortable beds and nice showers. A personal favorite from our scouting trip! Important note: only 4 rooms have exterior windows—the others have windows opening onto the interior stairwell. Be sure to request an exterior-facing room when booking.

**Kombinat Rooms** (20 rooms)
Well located less than 2 blocks from the church with modern, contemporary feel. All rooms are recently renovated. Half the rooms face the busy main thoroughfare, while the other half have very high windows (you'll get sunlight but limited views out the window). The church steeple is visible from many windows, which adds charm. Breakfast is included at the popular cafe next door. Note: the entrance is on a less charming street that connects to the pedestrian plaza.

**Arhiv**
Contemporary, modern rooms near two bustling restaurants, just off the pedestrian plaza with plenty of outdoor seating. Note: the entrance is modest, but the rooms themselves are renovated.

**Queen Palace**
Renovated rooms in a beautiful historic building immediately next door to the church and pedestrian plaza. Lovely rooms with comfortable beds and shared balconies overlooking the city rooftops. Note: the entrance is through an archway leading to a small elevator, which may feel a bit charming-but-rustic at first, but the rooms are well worth it.

## Full-Service Hotels

**Hotel Pupin**
Large, fully renovated rooms in a full-service hotel with two restaurants, walk-in closets, and high-end amenities. Located in an office building on the main road. To reach the pedestrian zone and church, you'll walk through an underground tunnel. Reception is accessed via elevator.

**Hotel Centar**
A standard hotel with modern amenities. The rooms look nice online. Note: the atmosphere is more functional than charming, and service may be less personal than at smaller properties.
